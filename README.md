# music_player

The Music Player is a Python application that allows users to play and manage their MP3 music files. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to select a directory containing their MP3 files. The application scans the selected directory and adds all the MP3 files to a playlist.

The player provides basic controls, such as play, pause, and resume, which are enabled using the pygame and playsound libraries. The user can also navigate through the playlist using the "previous" and "next" buttons.

To use the Music Player, simply run the script and select the directory containing your MP3 files. Then, select a song from the playlist and use the control buttons to play, pause, or resume the song, or to move to the next or previous song in the playlist.
